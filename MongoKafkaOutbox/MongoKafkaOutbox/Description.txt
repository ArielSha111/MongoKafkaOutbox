goal:
The goal of this nuget is to implement the outbox pattern using Kafka and mongo, 
henc e it is desiered to provide a way to create a transaction for the next action:
storing data in mongo and send a kafka event describing the data was saved succfully.
this is desiered as we wont want to store the data in mongo if we cant send the event.
the way it will work is:
1. trasaction is opened
2. data is stored to mongo
3. event data is stored to mongo is a so called outbox collection to say that the data needed was stored
4. only if 2 insertions worked the transaction is cloesed
5. side actions in the service will connsttently listen the this outbox collection
 and read the events from it
6. the reading should be thred safe
7. for each message an event should be send using kafka
8. when event was sent the item is removed from mongo using a state change

comments:
- Use Kafka Schema Registry
- the payload should be converted using AVRO format
- at the end of a valid convertion the data should be sent to schema registry
- data should be saved in the mongo using avro
- on the first phase we will only provide a way to trnsfer a session and an object we want to send in an event


Usage:
the usage should be via three methods:
1. store which stores in the outbox using avro
2. publish that publishes using schema registry and using the outbox
3. save changes to trigger the machanisem and to return a bool
4. Store and publish which does all the operations with saving (saving will trigger the needed action) should return bool
5. Store and publish which does all the operations without saving (a save shoud be used after it to trigger all) is void
